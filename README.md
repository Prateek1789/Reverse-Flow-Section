# Reverse-Flow-Section
This is a small project inspired by a website I saw on Awwwards.com called Q-Industrial. 
While navigating through the website what caught my attention was the scroll animation in the Services page where the height of each service row animates/increases against the normal document flow. As we scroll through the secton the height of each service row beautifully animates upwards whitout pushing down the content below.
I liked this scroll animation so much that I wanted to re-create this with only CSS and little help of JavaScript.
